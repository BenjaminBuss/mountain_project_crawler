## About the Project

This project was one of my earliest Python projects, and suffered from extreme scope creep. It started as a scraper to pull a few different items from local Mountain Project crags and then I'd create a "user profile" for everyone. It evolved into three different scrapers, the original one, one to scrape forum post, and one to scrape user ticks.

To read more about the original scraper you can check out the readme in the ClimbingScraper folder.
